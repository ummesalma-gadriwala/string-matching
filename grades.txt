Project Plan 3/3:
The plan should be more precise: what implementation languag do you intend to
use (and why), what input strings and patterns do you intend to use for
measuring?

Project Artifact Feedback:
- poster is nice, but too much text to read; shorten and organize as bulleted,
make more visual
- try to explain how the algorithms work, which is a (the?) challenge
- spell check, e.g. legnths
- put units on the diagrams
- acknowledgements are appreciated, however, if you are short on space, feel
free to leave them out
- the test string and test pattern look too simple: you may report separate
results for different patterns and strings; justify why you chose the test
strings and patterns (e.g. do you use some synthetic strings and patterns, do
you use real logs or dna sequences, do you use patterns with choice or without
choice and why, etc.)
- Conclusions: are these in line with what other people reported?
- Future work: either be specific or leave out
- among the exact and approximate algorithms, discuss their differences and
argue why you chose which
- are you going to document everything in a Jupyter notebook or differently?
