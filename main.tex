\section{Description}


A regular expression is a special text string for describing a search pattern. Let \(n\) be the length of the text, \(m\) be the length of a regular expression \(R\) for the alphabet \(\sum\). Further, let \(d\) be the number of strings in \(R\), where a string is a sequence of characters connected by concatenation.
\\\\
The traditional technique to search for an exact regular expression in a text uses \(O(mn)\) worst case search time with a space requirement of \(O(m)\) states, by converting \(R\) into a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA). An alternative algorithm converts the NFA into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and uses \(O(2^m)\) states and \(O(n)\) search time.
\\\\
Another interesting problem is approximate regular expression matching, that is searching for a given regular expression in a text allowing a limited number of errors \(k\), where \(k\) might be an insertion, a deletion or a substitution of a character by another. There exists a solution for this problem in time \(O(mn)\) and a solution for the case \(k = 0\) in time \(O(dn)\).
\\\\
To compare the performance of exact regular expression matching to approximate matching, we will implement the NFA-based algorithm and the Myers and Miller's algorithm.
